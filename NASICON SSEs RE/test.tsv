Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The increase of the M1 site size in Na2SnFe(PO4)3 is accompanied by <e1>oxygen displacements</e1> perpendicular to the c axis which give rise to <e2>rotation</e2> of the PO4 tetrahedra and leads to a distortion of the [Sn(Fe)x(PO4)3] framework .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This <e1>substitution</e1> allows the P / Si ratio to vary independently of the <e2>Na+ concentration</e2> but as there is no concomitant substitution of Na+ in the Zr / Sc site ( vide infra ) the Sc substituted NASICONS are stoichiometric .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In earlier structural studies it was shown that Na+ - Na+ repulsions play an important role in how the <e1>cavities</e1> fill , thereby affecting the resultant <e2>conductivity</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Regrinding and <e1>reheating</e1> the mix results in very slow <e2>incorporation</e2> of the free ZrO2 , probably by replacement of Na+ from the zirconium sites .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	It would appear that the stoichiometric compositions observed in the scandium substituted NASlCONs results from the Sc3+ occupying <e1>Zr4+ sites</e1> and effectively excluding <e2>Na+</e2> from doing so .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Apparently , the usability of NaTi2(PO4)3 and NaZr2(PO4)3 compounds to build ceramics with very <e1>low thermal expansion</e1> lies not only in the topology of bonds in the NZP structure , but also in the relative rigidity of the <e2>O-M-O bond angles</e2> , to prevent the skeleton to distort and become closer packed .
Other	Both phases above and below the transition point are rhombohedral and , as the lattice thermal expansion of the high temperature phase is like those of <e1>NaTi2(PO4)3</e1> and <e2>NaZr2(PO4)3</e2> , it has been suggested that these three phases are isostructural ( 1 ) , with NZP structure ( 2 ) .

Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The small excess of <e1>sodium</e1> ( <e2>0.11 atoms per formula unit</e2> ) is located in the Na2 site , which is a poorly constrained , irregular site at a general position .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Consequently , the successive sodium jumps between sites resulting in the static lattice potential , Na ( l ) Na(2) Na ( l ) , via the shallow potential mid-Na site imply a breathing like movement of the framework in perfect agreement with the <e1>dynamic tetrahedra </e1><e2>disorder</e2> observed in these crystals .

Component-Whole(e2,e1)	As previously observed ( 14 ) for the first crystal structure determination of the NASICON , further calculations reveal , for crystals in the composition range 2 < x < 2.4 , the occupation of a third <e1>sodium</e1> position within the conduction path , approximately halfway between ideal Na(1) and <e2>Na(2)</e2> positions ( 1.8 from each one ) .

Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The fact that cr is a maximum near x = 2,2 is compatible with electrostatic repulsions between <e1>Na+ ions</e1> forcing displacement toward the bottleneck positions , thus contributing to the large <e2>debye Waller factor</e2> .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The first observed <e1>phase transformation</e1> leads to an abrupt change in the electrical conductivity , whereas the second is marked by an in flection on the curve giving the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity and by a decrease in its <e2>activation energy</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Outside ( 0 x 1.8 and 2.4 < x < 3 ) the <e1>solid solutions</e1> show rather poor ionic conductivity and have <e2>rhombohedral symmetry</e2> already at room temperature .

Feature-Of(e2,e1)	<e1>NASICON structured materials</e1> are particularly attractive because they exhibit great <e2>structural stability</e2> , as well as fast ionic conductivity .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	To compete with a <e1>liquid electrolyte</e1> , the <e2>ionic conductivity</e2> of a solid electrolyte should be about 10(-2) S cm(-1) at room temperature .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	This <e1>ionic conductivity</e1> is quite substantial , and it is likely that the framework ionic conductivity can be enhanced considerably by the intentional introduction of Na vacancies , or by substitutions on the <e2>transition metal</e2> site .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Electrochemical intercalation or reaction with <e1>organometallic</e1> should allow the <e2>sodium content</e2> to be increased .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This is a consequence of the thermal stability of the material as it can not be <e1>heated</e1> above 800 <nUm> without partial <e2>decomposition</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Both end of which can take part in complexation of <e1>metal ions</e1> of varying sizes , which helps in preventing selective <e2>precipitation</e2> to maintain compositional homogeneity among the constituents .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The most significant consequence of the difference in the <e1>spatial arrangement</e1> of polyhedra is the number of cavities formed in the framework and their <e2>shape</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	<e1>The deviations of the dependences of unit cell parameters from the Vegard's rule</e1> are appar ently due to the flexibility of the structure framework and <e2>distortion of the anion packing of the solid solution</e2> as compared with the anion packing in the pure components .
Other	Different preparation techniques exist to reduce the size of crystallites ; among those hydrothermal , sol gel and <e1>co-precipitation</e1> are commonly used for <e2>NASICON synthesis</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Correlations are found between the structural distortion and electrical conductivity of the <e1>phosphates</e1> , on one hand , and the <e2>alkali cation</e2> size , on the other .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	( 2.50A ) is larger than that obtained from the <e1>ionic radii</e1> sum of Na and <e2>O2</e2> a higher degree of ionicity .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	The occupation factors are 0.92 and 0.79 , respectively for the disordered and y crystals at room temperature , whereas in the ordered <e1>cc phase</e1> the <e2>Na(l) site</e2> was found completely filled .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	Little change occurs in bond distances and <e1>angles</e1> in the (Zr2Si3O12)-4 framework whereas the Na(1)-O6 and <e2>Na(2)-O8 polyhedra</e2> enlarge dramatically with increase of temperature .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The overall <e1>conductivities</e1> increase with x but it is hard to discuss this variation as the porosities and <e2>grain boundary</e2> contributions are different along the series .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	The <e1>monoclinic structure</e1> of their <e2>crystals</e2> would also indicate that x is greater than 1.24 ; at least x = 1.6 is required to achieve the monoclinic structure ( 7 ) .

Condition-On(e1,e2)	The <e1>disorder</e1> is larger at <e2>100 K</e2> than at 295 K .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The <e1>thermal expansion</e1> of the crystallographic a-axis is two times larger than that of the <e2>c-axis</e2> .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	In the course of a systematic investigation of the electronic and <e1>chemical properties</e1> of compounds with the <e2>Nb3X4 structure</e2> the TlxTi6Se8 system has been synthesized in a wide homogeneity range ( 0.23 < x < 0.8 ) .
Condition-On(e1,e2)	The only known fact about the structure was that the <e1>c-glide plane</e1> , present above the transition point , is lost in the <e2>low temperature form</e2> .
Condition-On(e2,e1)	The component of the rotation of the <e1>edge O12 - O12</e1> in the phosphate group out of the ( 2110 ) <e2>plane</e2> is very small , but that of the edge O21 - O22 , around the [0001] direction is big .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This O(1) movement counteracts the <e1>M-O bond</e1> decrease which results in a very small variation of the <e2>a-axis</e2> along the series .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	Nevertheless , it is notable that the <e1>occupancy</e1> of the O ( 1 ' ) site reaches an apparent minimum at a value that is equal , within experimental error , to the occupancy of the <e2>Na(2' ) Site</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Given the low occupancy of this <e1>site</e1> , the variation in <e2>thermal parameters</e2> , and the general limitations of the Rietveld technique , it is difficult to assess the importance of this trend .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	As the <e1>temperature</e1> is increased , O(1') moves away from O(1 ) while at the same time , the occupancy of <e2>O( 1' ) diminishes</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	However , the refined populations of <e1>Na(2' )</e1> and O(1) are such that their sum is less than 100 % at all temperatures studied , so the disorder between O(1) and <e2>O(1' )</e2> may preclude the presence of such an unfavorable interaction in the structure .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Moreover , there is an apparent interaction between <e1>Na(2' )</e1> and <e2>O(1)</e2> of ca. 2.1 , significantly shorter than the 2.4 predicted for 6-coordinate sodium from ionic radii .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The expansion in the c direction , that is +0.652A , isduein +0.686A to the <e1>rotations</e1> and distortions in the <e2>PO4 group</e2> and in -0.034A to the face to face distance contraction of the TiO6 octahedron .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	More interesting is that the Na ( l ) occupation and obviously the <e1>mid-Na occupation</e1> are clearly related to the variations in <e2>conductivity</e2> with composition .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	For the compounds with compositions in the range 2 < x < 2.4 , the coordinates and <e1>thermal parameters</e1> obtained by <e2>X-ray crystal structure determinations</e2> are summarized in Table Il .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	These three preparation methods give <e1>crystals</e1> which differ somewhat from one another and in particular exhibit different structural characteristics and <e2>thermal behavior</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The mid-Na exhibits the expected behavior of an <e1>interstitial position</e1> within the conduction path with very large thermal components ( especially U22 , U33 , and IJ23 ) and a weak <e2>temperature dependence</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	At the first <e1>phase transition</e1> at 323 K , the average rhombohedral symmetry is restored , accompanied by a decrease in the ctrig <e2>lattice constant</e2> from 22.7 A to 22.3 .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	This obviously confirms that the <e1>occupation</e1> of mid-Na interstitial sites automatically excludes the occupation of neighboring equilibrium <e2>Na(2) positions</e2> .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	( c ) Finally , the high conductivity of NASICON was geometrically rationalized in terms of the <e1>dimensions</e1> of the window between Na ( l ) and <e2>Na(2) positions</e2> .
Method-Of(e2,e1)	which suggests that the observed stoichiometric differences can be attributed to the different paths by which each <e1>NASICON</e1> was prepared : high temperature solid state reaction , hydrothermal , or <e2>sol gel procedure</e2> ( 13 ) .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	recorded and assignments of the <e1>As - O</e1> stretching and <e2>bending modes</e2> were made .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	This indicates a change of <e1>lattice parameters</e1> to conform to the size of a new tetrahedral unit , <e2>(P,As)-O4</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	As well as <e1>charge carrier concentration</e1> , structural properties are also important factors in determining <e2>electric conductivities</e2> .
Method-Of(e1,e2)	One of the authors had calculated its thermal <e1>expansion</e1> ( 2 ) from room temperature up to 500 <nUm> , finding a negative <e2>thermal expansion coefficient</e2> of -5.5 x 10 -6 <nUm> C-1 by dilatometry , and a strong anisotropy , from high temperature X ray diffraction , with coefficients a(a) = -5.61 x 10 -6 <nUm> -1 ( 25 <nUm> to 500 <nUm> ) and a(c) = 12.8 x 10 -6 <nUm> -1 ( 25 <nUm> to 200 <nUm> ) and 28.1 x 10 -6 <nUm> C-1 ( 200 <nUm> to 500 <nUm> ) showing a deflection in the expansion along the hexagonal c axis .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	It has been shown that the first <e1>phase transformation</e1> in the range 40 - 60 <nUm> is accompanied by an increase in the <e2>density</e2> and a change to the space group Rc .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	The <e1>bottlenecks</e1> of diffusion lie within the faces of the <e2>NaO 6- octahedra</e2> .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	Each XO4 tetrahedron shares each <e1>corner</e1> with one MO6 octahedron and , conversely , each MO6 octahedron shares each corner with a different <e2>XO4 group</e2>
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Each <e1>XO4 tetrahedron</e1> shares each <e2>corner</e2> with one MO6 octahedron and , conversely , each MO6 octahedron shares each corner with a different XO4 group
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The mean thermal expansion coefficient , as defined by Cameron ef al. ( 16 ) is 0.52 x 10 <nUm> C-1 for the ZrO6 octahedron and <e1>0.33 x 10 <nUm> C-1</e1> for the <e2>SiO4 tetrahedron</e2> .

Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Because the <e1>Na2 site</e1> is special , only x ( o ) , 14 <e2>anisotropic temperature coefficients</e2> and the occupancy had to be refined .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The large thermal expansion of the sodium site is offset by <e1>rotations</e1> in the <e2>Zr-P polyhedral framework</e2> , thus yielding the low net expansion of NZP .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This <e1>rotation</e1> acts to increase the height of the <e2>Na(1) octahedra</e2> and is responsible for the anomalous maximum in the length of the c axis .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Therefore , as a function of the composition , small thermal changes are observed along the <e1>c axis</e1> and the variation of the volume <e2>expansion</e2> is essentially due to changes along the a axis .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	The <e1>zirconium octahedron</e1> ( point symmetry 3) contains three Zr-Ol bonds of 2.041 A and three <e2>Zr-O2 bonds</e2> of 2.094 A ( Table III ) .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	A fit of Rw(F) / R(F) = 0.019 / O.020 were attained when the Nal site and the <e1>oxygen sites</e1> were refined with additional higher order <e2>temperature factor coefficients</e2> ( TABLE III ) .

Located-Of(e1,e2)	From Fig.l , the alkali ion occupies an <e1>M 1 position</e1> , which has as nearest neighbors two octahedral site faces on <e2>opposite sides parallel to the basal plane</e2> .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	If <e1>anions bond</e1> to three network cations , layer structures such as x = <e2>alumina</e2> may be anticipated .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	me research reported here was motivated by active interest in <e1>solid electrolytes</e1> having fast <e2>alkali ion</e2> transport and by the proposition ( l ) that solid electrolytes having alkali ion conductivities approaching those of liquids should occur in skeleton structures .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Furthermore , the <e1>electrochemical performance</e1> can also be greatly improved by doping , shortening the ion - diffusion pathway , and by <e2>carbon coating</e2> .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	<e1>The companion cation of the network</e1> can have a <e2>tetrahedral site</e2> preference or an octahedral site preference .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	However , when the <e1>temperature</e1> increases , the <e2>Na ( l ) site occupancy</e2> slightly increases to the detriment of the mid-Na one and the mid-Na position slightly moves to the Na(2) position .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Atom <e1>Na(2)</e1> is 8-coordinate with regular <e2>Na-O bond distances</e2> .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	<e1>Atom Na(2)</e1> is <e2>8-coordinate with regular Na-O bond distances </e2>, By contrast Na(2f) is in 6-fold coordination consisting of atoms and two atoms .
Condition-On(e2,e1)	For the refinement of the 403K data <e1>anharmonic temperature factors</e1> ( 6 ) have been used up to third order for <e2>Na(2)</e2> and up to fourth or der for Na(1) .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	This set of semicircles indicates that several effects are involved in the <e1>electrical response</e1> of the pellets , including bulk and <e2>grain boundary</e2> contributions .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Therefore , only the total <e1>resistance</e1> , RTotal , as a sum of bulk and <e2>grain boundary</e2> phenomena was deduced from the impedance plot .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	They observed that the opening of <e1>bottleneck</e1> increases when the <e2>temperature</e2> is raised , which is associated with the decrease of the potential barrier and the increase of the hexagonal c parameter .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The changes in area of the T1 triangle ( as simplification to define the irregular M1M2 <e1>bottleneck</e1> ) correlate with variations in <e2>MAS NMR</e2> data and in the ionic conductivity properties with composition .

Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The appearance of three reflections at <e1>2 = 19.5 <nUm></e1> and two reflections at 2 = 28 <nUm> are characteristic for the presence of the <e2>monoclinic phase</e2> in the powder .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	High symmetry form of these compounds has a greater <e1>volume</e1> of large cation site and this volume can be reduced to a critical size for <e2>phase transformation</e2> by a reduction in temperature or increase in pressure or by substitution with a smaller alkali cation .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The microstructure and particularly the <e1>porosity</e1> have a significant impact on the <e2>conductivity</e2> .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The <e1>crystal symmetry</e1> is rhombohedra 1 at this temperature , but <e2>monoclinic</e2> at room temperature .
Condition-On(e1,e2)	Typically , the <e1>transition</e1> from the <e2>low - temperature phase</e2> to the high - temperature phase occurs around 400 C ~ 200 C and depends on the composition .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Concerning the <e1>fivefold coordinated mid-Na interstitial site</e1> , there is a relatively short average <e2>sodium - oxygen distance</e2> with participation of three oxygens of a face of the Na06 octahedron ( generally considered as the geometrical bottleneck for the diffusion ) and of two oxygens neighboring Na(2) sites .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The unique properties of <e1>NZP materials</e1> are attributed mainly to ( a ) an open framework structure with strongly bonded polyhedra , ( b ) flexibility with regards to ionic substitution , and ( c ) <e2>anisotropic thermal expansion</e2> of the lattice under thermal stress .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	<e1>High quality powder diffraction</e1> data in combination with the Rietveld method allow refinement of the structural model ( atomic coordinates , site occupancies , and atomic displacement parameters ) as well as of profile parameters ( <e2>lattice constants</e2> , peak shape and height , instrument parameters , and background ) .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	<e1>The volumes of the unit cells</e1> given for the monoclinic and <e2>rhombohedra 1 modifications</e2> are 1395 and 1398 , respectively .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	This is due to the similar nature of the <e1>conductivity</e1> of the <e2>grain boundary</e2> and in the bulk of the grains .
Condition-On(e2,e1)	<e1>Unit cell parameters</e1> were first refined without symmetry constraints ( i.e. , as <e2>triclinic</e2> ) ; all are consistent with hexagonal symmetry .
Condition-On(e2,e1)	We succeeded for the first time in growing single crystals of <e1>NASICON</e1> with monoclinic symmetry at <e2>room temperature</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Final refinements for each temperature for the <e1>NASICON phase</e1> included positional parameters for all atoms , isotropic thermal parameters for all non-sodium atoms , and <e2>population parameters</e2> for Na( 1 ) , Na(2) / Na(2' ) , and 1 ) / O( I )
Condition-On(e2,e1)	As previously reported ( 13 ) , a well crystallized <e1>NASICON phase</e1> can be prepared by sol gel technique after a <e2>thermal treatment</e2> above 11500C .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The <e1>bottleneck</e1> in the passageway from a Nal site to a Na2 or Naq site is a puckered hexagonal ring having sides that altemate between <e2>octahedral</e2> and tetrahedral edges .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	The <e1>open framework</e1> is built up from a complex arrangement of [NiO6] and <e2>[FeO6] octahedral</e2> and [PO4] tetrahedra .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The <e1>AsO4 tetrahedra</e1> are quite regular with an average As-O distance of 1.668 A which is lower than the value of 1.735 A estimated from the <e2>effectiveionic radii</e2> of four coordinated As(5+) and O(2) .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Each Na2 or Na3 site is connected through a bottleneck to two <e1>Na1 sites</e1> , but there is no <e2>passageway</e2> between Na2 sites or a Na2 and a Na3 site .
Instance-Of(e2,e1)	Additional refinement of higher order temperature coefficients of the Na sites at 993K yielded a <e1>Na diffusion path</e1> Na1 - <e2>Na2</e2> similar to that found in other NASICON compositions .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	After refinement of a basic model and an accurate definition of the atom positions , the <e1>occupancy</e1> of Na1 and <e2>Na2 sites</e2> were refined freely and were finally restrained to meet the criterion for charge balance .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	As this <e1>site</e1> is progressively filled , the environment becomes more regular , Table 3 , Na(2)-O(1) bond distances become shorter and <e2>Na(2)-O(2) distances</e2> larger .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Analysis of the IR spectra of the single <e1>phase vanadate phosphate samples</e1> indicated the presence of the PO4 and VO4 groups and the absence of <e2>condensed phosphates and vanadates</e2> .

Condition-On(e1,e2)	As there is no significant <e1>absorption band</e1> at about 1600 cm -1 where one would expect a vibration frequency of water , we conclude that the observed vibration band is with high probability caused by <e2>O-H</e2> defects in the crystal structure ; this kind of defects is well known in natural quartz ( 7 ) .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	Finally , from our recent <e1>crystal structure</e1> determination of the NASICON ( 14 ) , we have detected a new <e2>sodium position</e2> ( mid-Na ) in the conduction channel , intermediate between the usual Na ( l ) and Na(2) sites .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	Their high stability and ability to incorporate wide variety of different <e1>cations</e1> in the <e2>crystal structure</e2> are the reasons of which these substances are proposed as the hosts for immobilizing radioactive wastes .

Instance-Of(e1,e2)	The calcination at 800 <nUm> of the samples with compositions corresponding to x = 0.5 to 1.5 yields a NZP type <e1>phase</e1> as the major phase and SnP2O7 , TiP2O7 and unreacted <e2>SnO2</e2> as minor phases .
Other	It should be possible to extend the homogeneity range of this phase , and especially to increase the sodium content by electrochemical intercalation or by <e1>reaction</e1> with <e2>organometallic compounds</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The important advantage of such matrices compared to other candidate mineral - like matrices is ability to immobilize <e1>alkali metals</e1> in the <e2>insoluble</e2> phase .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Both structures contain a rigid , three dimensional network of <e1>PO4</e1> or ( Si04 ) tetrahedra sharing corners with <e2>Zr06 octahedra</e2> and a three dimensionally linked interstitial space .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The large thermal motion of Na(1) and <e1>Na(2)</e1> is probably related to the <e2>Na mobility</e2> in this structure .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	The <e1>structure</e1> is formed by a three dimensional network of AsO4 tetrahedra and <e2>ZrO6 octahedra sharing corners</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The global analysis of the structure at the four temperatures reveals that the <e1>structural transition</e1> is due to a fast rotation of the SnO6 and <e2>PO4 polyhedra</e2> around axes along the [0001] direction breaking the two fold axis in the R3c space group that exists in the structure above the transition point .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The <e1>PO4 polyhedra</e1> rotate strictly around the two fold axis in the high temperature phase , but around the [0001] direction in the <e2>low temperature</e2> form .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Thus it has been demonstrated that the anomalous <e1>thermal expansion</e1> behavior of NZP structure is correlated with rotations of <e2>polyhedra</e2> in the Zr-P framework .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The <e1>rotation</e1> ofessentially rigid polyhedra also is accompanied by thechanges in the environment and opening of the <e2>Na site</e2>
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The former is rhombohedral and the <e1>latter monoclinic</e1> at <e2>room temperature</e2> .
Other	The powder patterns of the three mixed <e1>sodium transition metal phosphates</e1> prepared within this study could all be interpreted assuming a <e2>hexagonal</e2> ( rhombohedral ) unit cell .

Located-Of(e2,e1)	The <e1>Na(l)</e1> position is localized at the intersection of three conduction channels , and this leads to a given Na(l) having six neighboring <e2>Na(2) positions</e2> distributed as two triplets at z 1 / 12 and rotated by Tt / 3 with respect to one another .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Therefore we deduce , that the Na2 <e1>occupancy</e1> increases with <e2>temperature</e2> at the expense of the interstitial sites ' occupancy because the Nal site is fully occupied at both temperatures .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In this model , it was assumed that the distances : RP1 , RP2 , RZ1 , RZ2 and DC would keep constant and that the equilibrium from the <e1>interatomic bonds</e1> would make any distortions in the <e2>octahedra</e2> and the tetrahedra proportional each other ( U ) with the residual effect ( T ) due to the fact that the structure can not be built by perfect octahedra and tetrahedra .
Condition-On(e1,e2)	The Na-O2 distance increases and the <e1>O2-Na-O2 angle</e1> decreases from <e2>65.6</e2> at 25 <nUm> to 63.4 <nUm> at 800 <nUm> , so the NaO6 octahedron distort more , away from 90 <nUm> , the angle of the perfect octahedron .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The relatively high internal R-values of the datasets of the <e1>T1 poor compound</e1> are due to the <e2>macroscopic damage</e2> of the crystal during the chemical reaction .

Located-Of(e2,e1)	Clearly the spacing between these <e1>octahedral site</e1> faces , and hence<e2> the size of c T</e2> , will vary sensitively with the size of the M ~ cation .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	Since the <e1>site preference energies</e1> for the two positions are not equal , the activation energy for <e2>Na+ ion conduction</e2> may be large .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In such a case , the Na-O bonding is expected to be strong enough to make the <e1>activation energy</e1> for <e2>Na+ ion transport</e2> relatively larger .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The shortest diameter of the <e1>bottleneck</e1> is larger than 4.8 A , twice the sum of Na+ ion and 2 <e2>ion radii</e2> .
